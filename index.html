    <p>Howdy! I'm Mike, and I'm thoroughly excited to embark on this learning journey! I'm 28 and work for Amrock(been with Rocket Mortgage for 4 years), I have a 2 year old puppy named Aurora 
        that's my best friend,and I have a big ol'Zelda tattoo on my arm.</p>
     
<h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>

        <p>Ever since I was a wee lad, I've been apart of a lovely nerdy family. Whether it be building tech, collection of all things scify, or heavy video games. I would spend a lot of time hanging out with one of my favorite cousins at his house, whose 
        dad who used to work in robotics and would see him working on his projects or talk about code. It always grasped my interest from the get go of the process of being able to build the things we interact and use everyday online to the inner workings 
        of video game development as well. I thoroughly enjoy problem solving and my life motto is there is always a solution to every problem and I also enjoy the process of creating something of your own from the ground up. Always a satisfying feeling, along
    with the learning process along the way. Always something new to be learned.</p>

        <p>I came to Grand Circus from hearing about it through my work and constant chit-chat with people around me who have done it as well. Realizing I wanted more in my life and to finally dive into a career of something that sparks a constant flame of interest.
    Hearing of nothing but good things and awesome experiences going through Grand Circus, and going through the free intro courses multiple times as well, I finally had my heart set and decided on finally hopping into this awesome world
    of tech and knowledge. And Javascript Full-Stack is my first step towards my goals, and I've never been more excited.</p>
